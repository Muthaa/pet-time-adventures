## Setup

To run **PetTime Adventures*** on your local machine:

### Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Basic knowledge of how to run Python programs

### Installation Steps

1. Clone or download the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pet-time-adventures.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

    ```bash
    cd pet-time-adventures
    ```

3. Run the game:

    ```bash
    python pet_game.py
    ```

The game will prompt you to either adopt a new pet or load a saved one, and then you can start caring for your virtual pet!

## Game Flow

1. When you first start the game, you can choose to adopt a new pet or load a previously saved one.
2. The game will enter an interactive loop, allowing you to choose from various actions such as feeding, playing, or training.
3. Each time you take an action, the pet‚Äôs stats (like hunger, energy, happiness, and health) will be updated.
4. If you neglect your pet for too long, they might run away. Keep an eye on their status to ensure they stay happy and healthy!
5. You can save your progress at any time and load it later to continue where you left off.

## Key Concepts

- **XP & Leveling Up**: Your pet gains experience points (XP) through different actions like playing, eating, and training. Once they accumulate enough XP, they will level up, becoming stronger and more capable of handling different tasks.
- **Mood**: Your pet‚Äôs mood will change based on their needs. If they‚Äôre happy, you‚Äôll see a "üòä Happy" face. If they‚Äôre hungry, tired, or neglected, they will show their corresponding mood.
- **Inventory**: Your pet has a small inventory of items like kibble, treats, and fish. Use these items to keep them fed and happy.

## Saving and Loading

The game uses a `pet_save.json` file to save and load your pet‚Äôs progress. When you choose to save your game, the current state of your pet (including stats, tricks, inventory, and XP) will be saved to this file. If you want to load your pet's progress, the game will read from this file and restore your pet‚Äôs state.
